// Challenge:
// Here's a list of 5 most popular songs on Spotify.
// 1) Check if any song has won a Grammy
// 2) Check if all the songs were streamed for at least 1.5 million times
// Note: the timesStreamed value is already in million

const songs = [
    {song: "Shape of You", timesStreamed: 2.384, wonGrammy: true},
    {song: "One Dance", timesStreamed: 1.791, wonGrammy: false},
    {song: "Rockstar", timesStreamed: 1.781	, wonGrammy: false},
    {song: "Closer", timesStreamed: 1.688, wonGrammy: false},
    {song: "Thinking Out Loud", timesStreamed: 1.461, wonGrammy: true}
]



//solution
const result1=songs.some(songs=>songs.wonGrammy===true)
console.log(result1)
const result2=songs.every(songs=>songs.timesStreamed>=1.5)
console.log(result2)



//output
true
false
